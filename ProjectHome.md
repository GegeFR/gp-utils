# Introduction #

This project contains code I wrote to suit my needs in my professional (or not) work.

# Details #

Interresting things :
  * **gp-utils**
    * **high-performances** and **simple-usage** classes for managing **arrays of bytes** (created for the stack gp-net-radius and then used for many things)
    * a **scheduler**, just a pool of threads executing tasks at precise dates.

  * **gp-utils-swing**
    * FileChooser : **alternative** to the default JFileChooser (I really don't like it in windows). Openly inspired from the GTK filechooser. It does not support modifying the bookmarks yet. bookmarks are customizable. There is still work, but I'll finalize this when I (or someone else) will begin to use it for real.
